Logical Model
=================

This defines some core interfaces for the definition of Logical Models.
It also provides some tools for the manipulation of such models.


Where does it come from?
------------------------

Most of this comes from a refactoring of GINsim to cleanup its core and enable more code sharing.
The aim is to implement here some core tools to allow better interoperability between several java modeling softwares.
